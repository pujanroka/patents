This is a patent pending application with an official USPTO number assigned to it. As of 2024, this patent is being vetted against other prior arts. Soon after this patent was published, USPTO notified of several Silicon Valley companies creating other similar patents resembling the claims I outlined in this patent. While I am spinning off other patents using new learnings, I am posting this in public domain if anyone is interested in 1) creating similar patents, or 2) collaborating with me on its new evolution.

Abstract: A transportation network system that provides machine intelligence relating to at least one road and a periphery of the at least one road includes: a plurality of sensors for identifying static and moving objects on the at least one road, spatial dimensions of the objects with respect to the at least one road, and an environment around the objects, the sensors being configured to translate and store the identified objects, spatial dimensions, and environment as machine readable data; a plurality of communication devices and transmitters for transmitting the machine readable data between the plurality of sensors and to remote computer cloud systems; and a computer cloud system for receiving the machine readable data from the plurality of communication devices and to store the machine readable data, the computer cloud creating machine intelligence based on the machine readable data, the computer cloud system including an application programming interface.
